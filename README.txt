What is TaxIPP-Life ?

TaxIPP-Life (TIL) is microsimulation model over life cycle.
There is two parts in that model, the first one is ageing population, the second is simulating tax and benefit system.  
The latter is done using OpenFisca (www.openfisca.fr), the first one is done using a version of Liam2 (http://liam2.plan.be)

The development of TaxIPP-Life is a FLOSS project wich code is distributed 
under the GPL licence version 3 or later (see license.txt). 
The source code is freely available and still undergoes heavy development.
